## The Basics

This is the readme file for the RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) project. The API is designed to allow developers to access and solove data from a web application or service.

## Quick Start

You can make requests to the API using HTTP. Requests can be made using various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

## Error Handling 

Inevitably, errors will occur when using an API. To help developers debug issues with their applications, the API should provide detailed error messages that indicate what went wrong.

Error messages should include the HTTP status code, a message describing the error, and any additional information that could help the developer resolve the issue.
